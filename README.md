Aight here is the readme

Project 1 - focuses on RSA and figuring out primality. Not too much going on there - just rabber millins and prime checking. 
Project 2- convex hull - this is a good project on recursion and using a smarter algorithm. was a lot of fun to figure out and took my brain and made it a pretzel. 
Project 3 - Dijkstras and priority queues - using dijkstras on various graphs and then an array and heap implementation of a priority queue. fun!
Project 4 - this is the one I showed you either - contains the files for edit distance (dynamic programming) so this is probably the one you are going to want to look at
Project 5 - Traveling salesperson problem. works with branch and bound. Not sure how useful this will be for you but there it is!
let me know if you have any questions - this is all designed to run out of the box for python 3.12 on windows. if you are not using that you might get some unexpected behavior. Also, you will need to import a few libraries, I had a special cconda environment set up for this project repo.
